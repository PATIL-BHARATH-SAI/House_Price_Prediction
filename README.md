# House Price Prediction

Welcome to the House Price Prediction project! This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various features. It's a common project in the field of data science and machine learning.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset [describe the source of your dataset and its key features]. The dataset contains [briefly describe the key features and target variable].

## Model

I have implemented a machine learning model using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn. The model's goal is to predict house prices accurately based on the available features.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required libraries
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to see the model in action.

## Usage

You can use this project as a reference for building your own house price prediction models or for learning about regression analysis in data science. The Jupyter Notebook provides detailed explanations and code for each step of the process.

## Results

The model achieves an [R-squared score] on the test dataset, indicating its ability to make reasonably accurate house price predictions.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements, additional features, or alternative machine learning models, please open an issue or create a pull request.
